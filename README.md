# Land Cover Classification Data Augmentation

This project involves the augmentation and analysis of land cover classification data. It includes scripts for processing images, visualizing changes in land cover over time, and evaluating model performance. 

## Project Overview

This repository contains scripts for:

- **Data Augmentation:** Enhance land cover classification datasets using various techniques.
- **Inference:** Apply trained models to infer land cover classifications on new data.
- **Comparison and Evolution Analysis:** Compare land cover changes between different years and visualize the evolution of land cover classes.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and usage instructions.
- `DATAaug/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data augmentation.
- `Inference/`: Scripts for running inference with trained models.
- `Train/`: Training scripts for model training.
- `auxiliary/`: Helper scripts for various auxiliary tasks like evolution analysis and change detection.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install first:

- `mmsegmentation`: This library is used for training and inferring models in this project. It provides tools for semantic segmentation.(https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation)
